Headline:  Pirates seize cargo ship in Indian Ocean

Classifier4J Headline:  Somali pirates have seized a cargo vessel with 22 crew members.

Content:  Somali pirates have seized a cargo vessel with 22 crew members. The Greek-owned MV Filitsa was hijacked on Wednesday in the Indian Ocean, several hundred kilometres northeast of the Seychelles islands. The ship was carrying cargo from Kuwait to South Africa. The European Union's anti-piracy force Atalanta said the crew includes three Greeks and 19 Filipinos. The ship has turned around and is now heading north, Atalanta said. There were conflicting reports as to whether the vessel was seized 400 kilometres or 750 kilometres off of the Seychelles coast. There are reports that Somali pirates have also hijacked a fishing boat, but identity of that vessel was not immediately clear. The pirates have hijacked at least eight boats in the Indian Ocean since the start of October. They are holding at least a dozen ships overall, with more than 200 crew members. Naval forces from the United States, EU, NATO, and other world powers are patrolling the waters around Somalia trying to protect commercial shipping; however, the patrols appear to have had little impact on the pirates, who have focused their efforts on the vast Indian Ocean. Many hijackings have occurred near the Seychelles, a group of islands southeast of Somalia.

Headline:  Students Gain Early Access to 2004 HSC Results

Classifier4J Headline:  Approximately 100 students gained access to their Higher School Certificate results, before the official release date of Friday 17th December 2004.

Content  Approximately 100 students gained access to their Higher School Certificate results, before the official release date of Friday 17th December 2004. Police are pursuing the matter. The access was gained through the [http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/ Board of Studies] website. To read their results, the student required a .zip archive, which was being distributed among students using the Internet. This archive seems to have contained a URL. This URL was either directly to the board of studies site, or to a script/site which allowed as student to enter information then assembled a URL to the board of studies site, allowing students to view their results early.
