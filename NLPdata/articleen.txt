BBC Jam promotional image, with logo. Kids will have to look elsewhere for educational entertainment, after the European Commission received complaints that the British Broadcasting Corporation's website was "unfair competition" to the commercial online games market. The site, called BBC jam, will be suspended on March 20, 2007, pending review, per the BBC Trust. ''BBC jam'' offers educationally-oriented games aimed at 5 to 16-year-olds, created with an operating budget of £150 million (US$290 million) over five years, US$85 million of which allocated to independent content producers. The government funded service is formally requesting proposals on how it should promote education and learning digitally, without being "non-compliant". NUT Cymru, a Welsh teachers' union, is worried about the closure. Both NUT Cymru and the Welsh Assembly Goverment have questioned the extent to which commercial firms would step in and fulfill the terms of the Welsh Language Act 1993. ==Sources== * * Category:Europe Category:United Kingdom Category:Wales Category:Culture and entertainment Category:Television Category:Computing Category:Games Category:Education Category:Europe Category:European Union Category:European Commission Category:Welsh Assembly
Normal life in the Asom continued to be disturbed for third day in a row on Saturday following the series of subversive activities engineered by the banned United Liberation Front of Asom(ULFA). In the latest incident, Police on Saturday morning sounded red alert in the Guwahati city as an explosive timer device found in front of Kamrup SP office in Panbazar. "The recovered device was kept in a Tiffin box, which was programmed to explode at 6:15 [IST] in the evening," said police sources adding that the hand of ULFA was suspected. The passengers of Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express had a miraculous escape as a bomb planted on the tracks near Naharkatia in the Dibrugarh district detonated just before the superfast train was to pass last night, said official sources. On Friday night, at least six persons injured in the state, following five powerful blasts that was suspected to be triggered by the banned outfit. These blasts came barely hours after a powerful bomb explosion that killed five people and injured over 15 at a busy vegetable market in the Guwahati city on Friday evening. According to police, at least six persons injured when a bomb exploded in the house of one Milan Deori in Rupaisiding- Tapoban-Tiniali area in the Tinsukia district allegedly planted by ULFA militants. Besides this the outfit reportedly blew off four Oil pipelines belonging to Assam Gas Company Limited and Oil India Limited (OIL) successively at two places in the Dibrugarh district last night. Police source said that two blasts occurred at 10:25 IST and 25 minutes later damaged pipeline used for electricity generation at Namrup Thermal Power plant at a place under Naharkatia police station.

Somali pirates have seized a cargo vessel with 22 crew members. The Greek-owned MV Filitsa was hijacked on Wednesday in the Indian Ocean, several hundred kilometres northeast of the Seychelles islands. The ship was carrying cargo from Kuwait to South Africa. The European Union's anti-piracy force Atalanta said the crew includes three Greeks and 19 Filipinos. The ship has turned around and is now heading north, Atalanta said. There were conflicting reports as to whether the vessel was seized 400 kilometres or 750 kilometres off of the Seychelles coast. There are reports that Somali pirates have also hijacked a fishing boat, but identity of that vessel was not immediately clear. The pirates have hijacked at least eight boats in the Indian Ocean since the start of October. They are holding at least a dozen ships overall, with more than 200 crew members. Naval forces from the United States, EU, NATO, and other world powers are patrolling the waters around Somalia trying to protect commercial shipping; however, the patrols appear to have had little impact on the pirates, who have focused their efforts on the vast Indian Ocean. Many hijackings have occurred near the Seychelles, a group of islands southeast of Somalia.

West Indies beat Ireland by 8 wickets (with 59 balls remaining) in the final Group D match of the 2007 Cricket World Cup at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica. As both teams had already sealed their progress to the Super 8 stage, this match was effectively a Super 8 encounter, as the points won today were carried through to the next stage. Ireland were missing their captain Trent Johnson after he failed to recover from a shoulder injury. Johnson was replaced by John Mooney, while Kyle McCallan deputised as captain. Rain delays toward the end of Ireland's innings meant the game was reduced to a 48 over match. West Indies' target was therefore revised under the Duckworth-Lewis method to 190 runs from their 48 overs. <b>Toss:</b> Ireland won, and decided to bat first. <b>Fall of wickets:</b> 1-3 (Porterfield, 1.2 ov), 2-61 (Morgan, 15.3 ov), 3-76 (NJ O'Brien, 20.2 ov), 4-82 (Bray, 21.6 ov), 5-129 (KJ O'Brien, 35.4 ov), 6-139 (Botha, 39.2 ov), 7-163 (White, 45.5 ov), 8-163 (Mooney, 45.6 ov) <b>Fall of wickets:</b> 1-24 (Gayle, 4.3 ov), 2-143 (Sarwan, 27.4 ov) <b>West Indies:</b> C H Gayle, S Chanderpaul, R R Sarwan, M N Samuels, B C Lara (capt), D J Bravo, D R Smith, D Ramdin (wkt), I D R Bradshaw, J E Taylor, D B Powell<br> <b>Ireland:</b> J P Bray, W T S Porterfield, E J G Morgan, N J O'Brien (wkt), K J O'Brien, A C Botha, W K McCallan (capt), J F Mooney, A R White, D Langford-Smith, W B Rankin <b>Player of the match:</b> S Chanderpaul (West Indies) Umpires: B F Bowden (New Zealand) and I J Gould (England) <br> TV umpire: B G Jerling (South Africa)<br> Match referee: R S Mahanama (Sri Lanka)<br> Reserve umpire: S J A Taufel (Australia)<br>
200px On its official blog Thursday evening, under the title, ''Encouraging People to Contribute Knowledge'', Google announced the first phase of testing of a tool designed to facilitate the organisation of "authoritative articles" written by users. The tool, dubbed "knol" for ''unit of knowledge'', will be similar to other online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. According to Google, knols would "cover all topics, from scientific concepts, to medical information, from geographical and historical, to entertainment, from product information, to how-to-fix-it instructions." In addition, site will be ad-revenue driven and authors who choose to allow advertisements on their knol will be able to share in "substantial" revenue derived from the ads. The pay scale was not revealed in the announcement. The content of the articles will not be vetted by Google. "Google will not serve as an editor in any way, and will not bless any content," said Udi Manber, Google VP of Engineering in the announcement. "All editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors," continued Manber. "We hope that knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their reputation on the line." Google will rank the submissions, or knols, in Google search results and will make the content available to other search engines. "We are quite experienced with ranking web pages, and we feel confident that we will be up to the challenge," said Manber. "We are very excited by the potential to substantially increase the dissemination of knowledge." Similar to wikis, the content of the knol site will be editable by users. "People will be able to submit comments, questions, edits, additional content, and so on," said Manber. "Anyone will be able to rate a knol or write a review of it." It was not made clear whether users other than the author would have to be registered or if anonymous editing would be allowed. The mock-up displayed on Google's blog entry shows an emblem for the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, which would enable sharing of information between such articles and other projects. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales had a wait-and-see approach to Google's latest offering, in an interview on Friday. "Google does a lot of cool stuff, but a lot of that cool stuff doesn't work out so great," said Wales. Commenting on the revenue-sharing aspect of the Google knol, Wales predicted there may end up being a focus on less academic submissions. "You may see an awful lot of articles about Viagra," said Wales. Google suggested that the tool is still in development and gave no indication of when it would come out of the testing phase and rolled out to the public. Testing is being carried out by an invitation-only group of participants.

John Boehner announced yesterday that he would agree to a two-month extension of the cut. In an effort to end the impasse between the House and Senate, Boehner told Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid that he would schedule a House vote on the Senate version of the bill that would extend the tax cut, which was due to expire at the end of the year. Speaker John Boehner ''(pictured)'' announced yesterday that he would agree to a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut. Speaker Boehner announced the agreement in a brief statement: "Senator Reid and I have reached an agreement that will ensure taxes do not increase for working families on January 1". Boehner informed other congressmen of the deal in a conference call yesterday evening. The House may pass the bill via today, which would not require the presence of all members. Boehner and Reid also agreed to a bipartisan negotiation committee to sort out differences and extend the tax cut for an entire year, a goal recently sought by Republicans in the House. The extension of the payroll tax cut, which would prevent approximately 160 million Americans from seeing a tax increase in 2012, had already been passed by the Senate last weekend. Earlier yesterday, Senate Republican leader joined several other Republican Senators in encouraging the House to pass the extension. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said that once the House acts, he "will be happy to restart the negotiating process to forge a yearlong extension." At a news conference, Speaker Boehner issued a statement: "We have fought the good fight. Why not do the right thing for the American people even though it's not exactly what we want." President Obama also responded to the development in a statement: "This is good news, just in time for the holidays. This is the right thing to do to strengthen our families, grow our economy, and create new jobs. This is real money that will make a real difference in people's lives." The tax cut extension impasse began when the House effectively rejected the Senate-approved version of the bill on Tuesday after being faced with opposition from House Republicans, specifically those associated with the Tea Party movement, who advocated for spending cuts and the controversial . == Related news == *
A Hudson's Bay store in Montreal North America's oldest retailer, Canada's Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), will be transferred from one American owner to another. NRDC Equity Partners, LLC, owners of U.S. department store Lord & Taylor, will purchase HBC from the estate of Jerry Zucker, who died in April. In 2006, the fate of HBC was first in doubt when Zucker bought it for $1.1 billion from another American owner. The businessman wanted to convert The Bay into a more upscale department-store chain. Zucker had also begun remodeling the company's Zellers chain to imitate the Target Corporation, creating wider aisles, expanding outlets, and selling at prices that matched those of the Wal-Mart Canada Corporation. NRDC plans to introduce up to 15 Lord & Taylor stores in Canada by converting some of HBC's existing properties, which include stores such as The Bay, Zellers and Home Outfitters. Under the deal announced on Wednesday, NRDC will support a newly-established holding corporation, the Hudson's Bay Trading Company, with $500 million in funding. The Hudson's Bay Company was established in 1670 to support trade and development throughout the northern North American territory that is now Canada.
Pejar dam near Goulburn, New South Wales The inland city of Goulburn is still facing major water restrictions despite an easing in drought in the State over the past few months. The water levels in the city's dam, the Pejar Dam, are still very low at 11% full, with the total water supply at 32% capacity in comparison to 36% capacity over the same period last year. Available capacity for the city at 31 October 2005 was still under 20% and the water consumption rate of the city is approximately half compared with the five-year average. Above average rainfalls in September 2005 have delayed some of the harder decisions facing the town in the middle of the year, such as the closing down of industries dependent on water usage. In May 2005, Pejar Dam was at 10% of its capacity and the town was looking at running out of water within eight months. There had been no significant rainfall since December 2004 and the dam was last full in November 2000.

The outgoing Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Mark Vaile today announced that he will resign as leader of the National party, following the Liberal/National party coalition government's defeat on Saturday. Mr Vaile took leadership of the National party after John Anderson's resignation in July, 2005. With his wife by his side, an emotional Mark Vaile said that he had considered his future in wake of the coalition's defeat and that he believed it was time for change within the National party. "Over the last couple of days and particularly as I drove to Canberra this morning with Wendy to come down and start packing up my office to make way for the incoming deputy prime minister, we reflected on a whole range of issues," he said. "We are at a point in the history of politics in Australia where we believe and I believe it is time for an opportunity for a bit of a change in the leadership of our party. I certainly don't want to stand in the way of that." Mr Vaile said that the past 11 or so years had been particularly difficult for his family. "It's been a long 10 or 11 years for my family whilst I've been away from home and they deserve a bit of time and that's what I want to give them," said Mr Vaile. Mr Vaile said he accepted some of the responsibility for the coalition's defeat on the weekend. "As the leader of my party I shoulder my share of the responsibility for the outcome on Saturday," he said. Mr Vaile also dismissed Liberal Wilson Tuckey's suggestion that the Liberals and Nationals should amalgamate. He said he continued to oppose the idea. "As far as amalgamation is concerned I've opposed it in the past and I'll oppose it in the future," he said. "My belief is that regional Australia is entitled to their unique voice and that's always been given to them by the Nationals and we have had proposals in terms of amalgamation, I've argued against it then and I'll argue against it in the future." Mr Vaile will continue to serve the remainder of his term for his constituency of Lyne on the backbench.
In late 2010 a geological expedition to Antarctica drilled through the Ross Ice Shelf so they could send an ROV under it. What they found was unexpected: . In their thousands they were doing what no other species of sea anemone is known to do &mdash; they were living in the ice itself. '''' and its habitat Discovered by the [Antarctic Drilling] project, the team was so unprepared for biological discoveries they did not have suitable preservatives and the only chemicals available obliterated the creature's . Nonetheless Marymegan Daly of Ohio State University confirmed the animals were a new species. Named '''' after the drilling project that found it, the anemone was finally described in a paper last month. ANDRILL lowered their cylindrical camera ROV down a freshly-bored 270 (890) hole, enabling it to reach seawater below the ice. The device was merely being tested ahead of its planned mission retrieving data on ocean currents and the sub-ice environment. Instead it found what ANDRILL director Frank Rack of the , a co-author of the paper describing the find, called the "total serendipity" of "a whole new ecosystem that no one had ever seen before". The discovery raises many questions. Burrowing sea anemones worm their way into substrates or use their tentacles to dig, but it's unclear how ''E. andrillae'' enters the hard ice. With only their tentacles protruding into the water from the underneath of the ice shelf questions also revolve around how the animals avoid freezing, how they reproduce, and how they cope with the continuously melting nature of their home. Their diet is also a mystery. ''E. andrillae'' is an opaque white, with an inner ring of eight tentacles and twelve-to-sixteen tentacles in an outer ring. The ROV's lights produced an orange glow from the creatures, although this may be produced by their food. It measures 16&ndash;20mm (0.6&ndash;0.8in) but when fully relaxed can extend to triple that. Genetic analysis being impossible, Daly turned to dissection of the specimens but could find nothing out of the ordinary. Scientists hope to send a biological mission to explore the area under the massive ice sheet, which is in excess of 600 miles (970km) wide. The cameras also observed worms, fish that swim inverted as if the icy roof was the sea floor, and a cylindrical creature that used appendages on its ends to move and to grab hold of the anemones. NASA is providing funding to aid further research, owing to possible similarities between this icy realm and , a moon of Jupiter. Biological research is planned for 2015. An application for funding to the U.S. National Science Foundation, which funds ANDRILL, is also pending. The ANDRILL team almost failed to get any samples at all. Designed to examine the seafloor, the ROV had to be inverted to examine the roof of ice. Weather conditions prevented biological sampling equipment being delivered from McMurdo Station, but the scientists retrieved 20&ndash;30 anemones by using hot water to stun them before sucking them from their burrows with an improvised device fashioned from a coffee filter and a spare ROV thruster. Preserved on-site in ethanol, they were taken to McMurdo station where some were further preserved with . This map shows the location of the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic, and the two known localities for ''E. andrillae'' relative to McMurdo Station How did you come to be involved with this discovery? ::'''Marymegan Daly''': Frank Rack got in touch after they returned from Antarctica in hopes that I could help with an identification on the anemone. What was your first reaction upon learning there was an undiscovered ecosystem under the ice in the Ross Sea? ::'''MD''' I was amazed and really excited. I think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate, because it implies that there was a well-founded expectation of something. The technology that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important because, given our lack of data, we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like, or what it shouldn't be like. There's a return trip planned hopefully for 2015, with both biologists and ANDRILL geologists. Are you intending to go there yourself? ::'''MD''' I would love to. But I am also happy to not go, as long as someone collects more animals on my behalf! What I want to do with the animals requires new material preserved in diverse ways, but it doesn't require me to be there. Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live, and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones, ship time is expensive, especially in Antarctica, and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there, they should have priority to be there. These animals are shrouded in mystery. Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical; do they produce some kind of , and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own? Talk us through the difficulties encountered when trying to find answers with the specimens on hand. ::'''MD''' The samples we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in (a kind of formaldehyde solution). The formalin is great for preserving structures, but for anemones, it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body. This means we can't look at the issue you raise with these animals. What we could do, however, was to study anatomy and figure out what it is, so that when we have samples preserved for studying e.g., the , , or , or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves, we can make precise comparisons, and figure out what these animals have or do (metabolically or chemically) that lets them live where they live. Daly explained how she obtained these images of the anemone's anatomy. ::Just knowing a whole lot about a single species isn't very useful, even if that animal is as special as these clearly are &mdash; we need to know what about them is different and thus related to living in this strange way. The only way to get at what's different is to make comparisons with close relatives. We can start that side of the work now, anticipating having more beasts in the future. ::In terms of their glow, I suspect that it's not theirs &mdash; although luminescence is common in anemone relatives, they don't usually make light themselves. They do make a host of florescent proteins, and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow. What analysis did you perform on the specimens and what equipment was used? ::'''MD''' I used a dissecting scope to look at the animal's external anatomy and overall body organization (magnification of 60X). I embedded a few of the animals in wax and then cut them into very thin slices using a , mounted the slices on microscope slides, stained the slices to enhance contrast, and then looked at those slides under a (that's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper). I used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue to see the stinging capsules (=). ::I compared the things I saw under the 'scopes to what had been published on other species in this group. This step seems trivial, but it is really the most important part! By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found, I figured out what group it belongs to, and was able to determine that within that group, it was a new species. It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication, why did it take so long? ::'''MD''' You mean, how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly, right? :) It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out. Some of that time was just lost time &mdash; I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish. Once we figured out what it was, we played a lot of manuscript email tag, which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel, field work, etc. Manuscript review and processing took about four months. What sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used, and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact DNA? ::'''MD''' The preservation was not unorthodox &mdash; they followed best practices for anatomical preservation. Having DNA-suitable material will let us see whether there are new genes, or genes turned on in different ways and at different times that help explain how these animals burrow into hard ice and then survive in the cold. I am curious about the population structure of the "fields" of anemones &mdash; the group to which ''Edwardsiella andrillae'' belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually, and it's possible that the fields are "clones" produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction. DNA is the only way to test this. Do you have any theories about the strategies employed to cope with the harsh environment of burrowing inside an ice shelf? ::'''MD''' I think there must be some kind of antifreeze produced &mdash; the cells in contact with ice would otherwise freeze. How has such an apparently large population of clearly unusual sea anemones, not to mention the other creatures caught on camera, gone undetected for so long? ::'''MD''' I think this reflects how difficult it is to get under the ice and to collect specimens. That being said, since the paper came out, I have been pointed towards two other reports that are probably records of these species: one from Japanese scientists who looked at footage from cameras attached to seals and one from Americans who dove under ice. In both of these cases, the anemone (if that's what they saw) was seen at a distance, and no specimens were collected. Without the animals in hand, or the capability of a ROV to get close up for pictures, it is hard to know what has been seen, and lacking a definitive ID, hard to have the finding appropriately indexed or contextualized. Would it be fair to say this suggests there may be other undiscovered species of sea anemone that burrow into hard substrates such as ice? ::'''MD''' I hope so! What fascinates me about sea anemones is that they're able to do things that seem impossible given their seemingly limited toolkit. This finding certainly expands the realm of possible. ==Sister links==
Despite controversy ignited by the White House nomination of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank (WB), the 24-member board of directors voted unanimously on Thursday to accept his confirmation. A whirlwind tour by Wolfowitz, who traveled to many capital cities of the bank’s major shareholders and met with voting board members, quieted misgivings over his succession to the incumbent president John Wolfensohn. Widespread criticism of the Wolfowitz role in the US build-up to war in Iraq heightened levels of security concerns within the bank as they anticipate his arrival. The WB, from the executive level down to memos circulated among departments, express concern for it becoming the target of terrorist attack. The level of seriousness being taken by WB led it to set up cost estimates for improving security. Wolfowitz will assume leadership in June this year. Despite a belief by some that he acts unilaterally and lacks development experience, a European Commission spokeswoman, speaking for Commissioner Olli Rehn, told a news conference that[Rehn] "was satisfied with everything he heard from Mr Wolfowitz concerning free trade and also on poverty reduction and development policy." The ''Associated Press'' quotes the Belgian Development Aid minister saying, "There are no objections of EU countries." The public display of support belies dissention underneath. ''Reuters'' reportedly received a confidential email that provided details of a comment line on an internal website for the WB staff who use it from their far flung locations. The feelings about the Wolfowitz nomination received 1,300 responses, mostly about the bank’s reputation and effectiveness under the new leadership. ==Related news== * *

Abu Zubair, an operative of the Pakistan-based terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jehadi-Islamia was gunned down in a joint operation involving Jammu & Kashmir State Police Special Task Force and the Indian Army. " On specific information, Zubair was killed in a fierce encounter in Handwara " said Nitish Kumar, a police official, adding the man was considered to have played a leading role in the Varanasi attacks. Kumar said Zubair came from the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and was attempting to flee to Pakistan. The twin blasts in the Sankatmochan temple and the Cantonment Railway station of the temple city of Varanasi on March 7, had left close to 20 dead and nearly 100 injured. ==Sources== * * * Category:India Category:Asia Category:Varanasi
250px Google is being sued by the Authors Guild, among others, due to the verbatim publishing of contents of their books in Google Print for Libraries, a search engine for searching books that started in December. The Authors Guild wants Google to make the content from books protected under copyright unavailable, as they claim that they have never given permission for their text to be published. However, Google offers the option of having their text removed from their databases. Google also claims that the text is used under ''fair use'', as they only include "snippets" of the text, and not the entire book. Also, Google sees Google Print as an incentive to authors, as it could help boost sales. “This ability to introduce millions of users to millions of titles can only expand the market for authors’ books, which is precisely what copyright law is intended to foster,” says Google. The lawsuit was filed by three writers in a New York federal court, and has the support from the U.S.-based Authors Guild. The suit acknowledges that text snippets presented via the internet to users is legal under the U.S. definition of ''fair use''. Rather, the complaint centers on the wholesale copying of a book's text into Google databases. Another Google Print program, called "Google Print for Publishers", seeks consent from publishers (such as Simon & Schuster, who has given permission) to publish their works. Considering as publishers ''may'' be holders of the copyright in book contents, this could be the sole project of Google Print, assuming Google Print for Libraries is deemed "massive copyright infringement" by the District Court in Manhattan where the suit was filed.
excerpt showing area where incident took place A man has been admitted to hospital, having been seriously injured when hit by a car in Glasgow, Scotland. The accident took place at approximately 0345 on Sunday morning. The 30-year-old victim was run over by a car in the vicinity of John Knox Street and Wishart Street in the east end of the city. The pedestrian was transferred to the after initially being transported to . The condition of the passenger, who experienced a serious head injury, was described as serious albeit stable by hospital staff. The 48-year-old driver, who alerted emergency services to the incident, was uninjured but apparently shaken. Sergeant Jo McPherson of Police Scotland said of the area in which the accident occurred: "Despite it being in the early hours of the morning this route can often be busy with taxis and cars as people make their way out of the city centre." Appealing to potential witnesses for information, Sergeant McPherson said: "The area is also overlooked by residential flats and it's possible someone may have witnessed the crash from their flat."
''Dante'', a tropical storm in Southeast Asia, has killed at least eleven people and displaced tens of thousands in the Philippines. Government authorities reported that nine persons were missing after a mudslide resulting from the storm in the coastal village of Maganelles. Regional disaster official Bernardo Alejandro said that the army and police were using shovels to search for the missing people, who are feared to have been buried in the mudslide. Nine persons, among them two children, have been found. According to Alejandro, the other casualties were a fisherman who drowned off the coast of the Camarines Norte province and a man who attempted to ford a swollen creek and drowned. Meanwhile, 45,000 people were evacuated into school shelters from their residences near the Mayon volcano, following concerns that mudslides may begin in the area. According to a government weather meteorologist, Manny Mendoza, the typhoon was estimated to have sustained maximum winds of 95 kilometres per hour, with gusts of up to 120 kph. At last report, it is predicted to be about 110 kilometres off the northeastern coast of the islands. Typhoons are not rare in the Philippines; an average of 20 storms strike the area every year. This storm, however, was unusual because it hit in the middle of the Philippine summer, while most typhoons appear only after June. Alejandro said that global warming, which may have caused weather patterns to change, could have been the reason for the unusual occurrence.
The US Senate rejected Wednesday a bill amendment aimed at increasing the security of gun background checks, on what President Barack Obama described as "a shameful day for Washington." President Barack Obama. On April 10 Senator , accompanying Senator in announcing the amendment, said it aimed to make "it more difficult for criminals and mentally ill people to obtain guns". The amendment would expand checks to sales online and at gun shows. The vote followed weeks of campaigning by the President, who was supported by a speech by Michelle Obama describing his proposed measures as "common sense." The bill received only 54 of the required 60 votes to proceed, despite strong public support for tighter gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting last year. Gun rights groups have campaigned strongly against the vote, claiming that the measures would violate constitutional rights, and targeting individual Senators with mocking material appearing online. Other proposed amendments to the bill which endeavoured to ban the sale of assault weapons like the one used in the Sandy Hook shooting and to place limits on the amount of ammunition which could be purchased in a single transaction also failed to garner sufficient votes. An onlooker in the gallery shouted "Shame on you" as the result of the vote was announced. The President spoke to the press and spectators shortly after the vote was announced, passionately assuring his audience that he would continue to pursue measures to reduce the incidence of gun violence in the United States.
Dennis Ferguson, a convicted paedophile has become the center of a row between Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisale, and Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie. Mr Ferguson moved to Ipswich, north of Brisbane, Australia after being forced out of his previous home by picketers in Murgon in the South Burnett region of Queensland yesterday. A group of protesters have now gathered outside Mr Ferguson's new home in Ipswich, who at one stage threw rocks at the house. The Mayor has defended the actions of the protesters saying "All the residents are doing is showing their democratic right - what they feel - and I think that in this country, they have a right to do that," he said. "I think the only thing left is institutionalise. I think that's the only thing left in this community because you just can't keep shifting the problem all over the state and all over the country until people start showing signs of remorse and show signs of whether they've been rehabilitated." However the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, reponded by asking Mayor Paul Pisale what he meant by "institutionalised". "To do what?" he said."Okay, so you actually believe that somebody should be locked up forever? We have laws in this state now, and I will talk to Paul about this, which basically say that a paedophile will not be released if they're a danger to the community."

World locator map with Ethiopia highlighted in green. The celebrations to mark the 60th birthday of Bob Marley, the reggae musician who died of cancer in 1981, have been marked by controversy. Since his death these festivities have always taken place in Jamaica, but this year they are taking place in Ethiopia, and particularly in the town of Shashamane, which is where the former Ethiopian Emperor and Rastafarian God Haile Selassie gave land to the Rastafarians to settle on nearly 40 years ago. The controversy was sparked last month by Bob's wife Rita Marley's comments that she wanted his body to be reburied in Ethiopia. Such was the wave of disapproval generated that she quickly backed away from her original statement, but the question as to where his remains should lie is now being hotly debated both in Jamaica and the rest of the world. As a Rastafarian Bob Marley's spiritual home was in Africa, and specifically in Ethiopia. Yet he only visited the country once, and according to those who want his remains to stay in Jamaica, he was entirely a product of Jamaican culture.

A new report released by the National Wildlife Federation finds that, in the United States, the animals of many different species, including species eaten by humans, are contaminated with mercury at levels higher than previously thought. Mercury poisoning in humans, which can result from eating contaminated animals, leads to a wide range of conditions, including kidney and neurological damage, fatigue, vision problems, and tremors. Mercury poisoning in some animals is severe enough to result in death or reduced fecundity. Chickens become contaminated with mercury from eating contaminated insects. While many people are aware of mercury contamination of fish, more recent studies have found that insects, and animals that eat them, also have high levels of mercury. Felice Stadler, from the National Wildlife Federation, says that "the research shows birds that eat contaminated insects get contaminated themselves. Turkeys and chickens, which humans eat, eat those same contaminated insects, so this is the tip of the iceberg." Confirming previous studies, the report also finds high mercury levels in animals that eat fish. Because of the high mercury levels, 46 of the 50 states have issued advisories for pregnant women and children against eating certain types of fish, including tuna and swordfish. States have also issued other warnings because of mercury-contaminated foods. For example, Florida has issued a warning against eating alligator meat; Utah, against eating shoveler and goldeneye ducks. According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, the National Wildlife Federation is the largest American conservation organization. The report, released on Tuesday, is based on 65 different scientific studies conducted by more than 20 scientists. It highlights that, in the United States, mercury is accumulating in a diversity of species, including species of fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and in a diversity of environments, including freshwater, marine, and forest habitats. Some of the animals in which mercury is accumulating include songbirds, alligators, turtles, bats, otters, polar bears, mink, ducks, loons, and bald eagles. Felice Stadler says that the report "underscored how pervasive mercury contamination has become. Nearly every aspect of our food web has been contaminated. It's difficult to find an ecosystem that's not contaminated, whether it's ocean or forest or coastal waters or wetlands." According to Wikipedia, mercury exposure in humans can result in brain damage, birth defects, severe neurological consequences, mercurial ptyalism, Minamata disease, and possibly autistic behaviors. In the United States alone, mercury pollution is about 100 tons per year. Primary sources of pollution include coal-burning power plants, waste water treatment plants, and waste incinerators.
The Kurdish population of Iraq celebrated today the appointment of veteran Kurdish leader Jala'''l Talabani as t'''he country's new president. The confirmation comes after Iraqis braved suicide bombings and other attacks to vote on the future of their country's Government more than two months ago. As well as electing Talabani, Iraq's Parliament also appointed Shi'a Adel Abdul Mahdi and Sunni Arab tribal leader Ghazi Yawar as vice presidents. "This is the new Iraq -- an Iraq that elects a Kurd to be president and an Arab former president as his deputy," said Parliament speaker Hajem al-Hassani earlier. During Saddam Hussein's rule, the Sunni minority dominated Iraq, while Shi'ite communities were oppressed and the Kurdish population massacred as they fought against Saddam's regime. The Kurds make up 20 percent of the country's population, while Shi'ites make up 60 percent and the Sunni Arabs make up between 15 percent to 20 percent. Reports say Talabani has pledged to work with all ethnic and religious factions to rebuild Iraq and has called upon neighbouring countries to stop insurgents from further disrupting Iraq. Although his post is seen by some as a ceremonial position, Talabani's role will include overseeing the completion of Iraq's new constitution by August this year and appointing Shi'ite leader Ibrahim al-Jaafari as Iraq's prime minister. Echoing the comments of many Kurdish Iraqis, Mohammed Saleh, a 42-year-old Kurd in Kirkuk, told reporters: "Today Jalal Talabani made it to the seat of power, while Saddam Hussein is sitting in jail. Who would have thought." According to agency reports, Saddam Hussein, imprisoned at a U.S.-run high security facility on the outskirts of Baghdad, was said to be "clearly upset" as Iraq moved closer to becoming a democratic state again. Watching the election results unfold live on Iraqi television, Saddam "realised that it was over, that a democratic process had taken place and that there was a new, elected president," Iraq's human rights minister Bakhtiar Amin told Reuters earlier today.
A man from the east Indian city of Kolkata was force-fed 50 bananas, after he swallowed a gold necklace he stole worth around 45,000 rupees ($1,110). Sheikh Mohsin, 36, stole the necklace from a businessman's wife whilst she was toy shopping. When arrested, he denied he stole the necklace, but an X-ray proved that necklace was inside him. In an attempt to get the necklace back, doctors advised the police to feed him bananas, saying they would act as a laxative. Mohsin was fed 50 bananas, but the laxative effect failed to take place. The police then fed him rice, chicken and bread. He was x-rayed twice during the day, and it was not until the fifth attempt when the necklace was finally excreted. A sweeper was paid 50 rupees ($1) for recovering the necklace from the toilet, and Mohsin was forced to clean it. Moshin pled for release but this was refused. He will be put in court in Kolkata on August 6, where he could face up to three months imprisonment for "snatching". ==Sources== * * Category:Crime and law Category:Wackynews Category:India Category:Asia Category:Kolkata
US Army Staff Sargeant Robert Bales Robert Bales, 38, a sergeant, was formally charged with seventeen counts of premeditated alongside six counts of attempted murder on Friday. Bales was charged in connection with a shooting spree in two southern Afghanistan villages earlier this month. Sources indicate the incident has further aggravated US-Afghanistan relations. US Secretary of Defense told reporters that he does not anticipate prosecutors seeking the death penalty. Officials also told reporters that more charges are anticipated, including derilection of duties, among others.

Browne has also speculated that Bales' mental state will become an issue at some time in the proceedings. Bales, a married father of two makes his home in Bonney Lake, Washington. He now awaits an , which is similar to a civilian hearing. Some sources indicate it could be months until a public hearing is held.

A masked protestor and a police officer at an English Defence League march in Newcastle. In response to a plan by the to hold a march next Saturday, the leader of Tameside Council, Kieran Quinn, has said the council will be requesting that the ban the EDL from marching through the town of , near the city of Manchester. Councillor Quinn described the EDL as a "hate-filled group wishing to come to Hyde to try and incite hatred".

Peter Fahy, the Chief Constable of , said that the police were concerned "that there could be a threat to peace and order". Fahy went on: "The attack was an awful crime but I'm not sure we need outsiders coming in, and clearly the fear is that they are just exploiting the situation."

The government has announced that the new minimum purchasing age to buy fireworks in New Zealand is 18-years instead of the current age of 14-years. Also the amount of time fireworks are available for sale during has been restricted to three days before instead of ten days. The has welcomed the new restrictions despite them calling for a complete ban. The Environment minister, Honourable , said: "This aims to restrict young teenagers from purchasing these potentially harmful explosives, and to make the Guy Fawkes season less taxing for the Fire Service and Police. We want to see fireworks users behaving responsibly, being aware of and avoiding fire risk, guarding the personal safety of themselves and others, and being aware of the effect the noise has on animals." Further restrictions have also been announced which will ban the separate sale of . Sparklers will only be available for purchase in packs contained with other fireworks. This restriction is to try and prevent the dangerous, home-made "sparkler bombs." Mike Hall, chief executive of the New Zealand Fire Service, said that he is pleased with the new restrictions around the sale of fireworks. "I met with the minister in November and expressed the Fire Service’s concerns, and it’s good to see that some action has come out of that." In response to why the government had not banned the complete sale of fireworks, Hon Benson-Pope said: "I have listened to the various groups that do want a ban, and I am still open to that possibility in the future, but I believe the best approach at this stage is to tighten up the laws around sale." The government has asked the to investigate the fireworks available for purchase in regards to the style, design and the construction of the various fireworks. "...and next year government will consult with industry about new regulations in this area," Hon Benson-Pope said. Mr Hall said: "Obviously we won’t know whether or not the measures Mr Benson-Pope has introduced will go far enough until the Guy Fawkes period in 2007, but we certainly hope they will limit the chaos we have seen in the past couple of years." Hon Benson-Pope said: "Guy Fawkes is a fun event for thousands of families, and fireworks-related damage is caused by a small group of mostly young people. I don't feel it's fair on New Zealanders to ban fireworks sales at this stage because of the actions of a minority." "I understand the frustration the Police and Fire Service teams feel when faced with problems over Guy Fawkes, and I hope these new restrictions will send a message that deliberate harm or damage is criminal and is being clamped down on," Mr Benson-Pope said. The next Guy Fawkes day is November 5, 2007. == Gallery == <gallery> Image:Sparkler.JPG|Sparkler reaction. Photograph by Gabriel Pollard. Image:DSCF3779.JPG|Sparkler reaction.

Yinfeng Riverside Park, the main venue for the Invitational Games for the Deaf, Taipei 2008 soccer event. A number of relatively unknown entrants made the Taiwan 2008 Invitational Games for the Deaf soccer tournament an unpredictable event. Teams from Thailand, Australia, Iran (Silver Medalist in soccer at the 2005 Summer Deaflympics), Uzbekistan, Malaysia, and Japan took part. On September 6, soccer giants Thailand and Iran defeated Malaysia and Uzbekistan in shutouts of 11-0 and 9-0 respectively. Anothai Sathiyamat, Somsak Thongdee, Nares Numphakdee of Thailand all scored hat-tricks in the game against Uzbekistan. On the second day of competition, a decisive battle in Group A between Japan and Iran was keenly watched by Thailand, as one of the two teams would be their opponent in the finals. The game was scoreless in the first half, with conservative tactics from both teams. Iran's Mostafa Heydaribondarabadi scored rapidly after the second half started, but Shun Igasaki of Japan scored a penalty kick after a foul by Iran in the penalty area and tied the score again. The penalty became the key of the match when Tetsuya Kurata scored 5 minutes further in, as the Iranian players became frustrated by the penalty kick. Finally, Japan won with a final score of 2-1, and advanced to the championship match on the final day. After group standings were mostly stabilized in the third day of competition, Thailand and Japan handled their respective Group matches by replacing several substitutes with frequently lined-up players to defeat their opponents easily. They will face off on the final day for the gold medal of soccer event in the "Invitational Games for the Deaf, Taipei 2008". ===Final group standings=== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" width="80%" |- !Group A||Won||Drawn||Lost||GD||Group B||Won||Drawn||Lost||GD |- !Japan |2||0||0||+3 !Thailand |2||0||0||+12 |- !Iran |1||0||1||+10 !Australia |0||1||1||-3 |- !Malaysia |0||0||2||-13 !Uzbekistan |0||1||1||-9 |} ===Fixtures of the Final Day=== :Match-play Date: September 10, 2008. *5th Place Match: Malaysia vs Uzbekistan *Bronze Medal Match: Iran vs Australia *Gold Medal Match: Japan vs Thailand

Celtic started well when Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink shouldered Shunsuke Nakamura's cross over the bar after ten minutes. If the Dutchman had've been more precise Celtic could've controlled the game from the start. Five minutes later Scott McDonald played a one-two with Vennegoor of Hesselink who played a good short ball back which fell right for McDonald's left foot but he agonisingly hit wide. It wasn't all Celtic though. Spartak Moscow counter-attacked brilliantly and nearly scored 17 minuted in. Artur Boruc made a last-ditch save and Lee Naylor cleared after Vladimir Bystrov cut the ball back to Dmitri Torbinsky just outside the box. Just 60 seconds later Aiden McGeady hit a good shot wide of the Moscow goal. Then 25 minutes in, the referee made the worst decision of the match. Welliton, the Brazilian striker, shot straight at Artur Boruc and the ball bounced off him and hit Gary Caldwell's grounded hand. The referee gave the penalty. There was nowhere for Caldwell to go and the penalty should not have been given. However Pavlyuchenko's penalty hit the post. 2 minutes later Celtic showed no signs of giving up. Scott McDonald scored his first Celtic goal after Massimo Donati's shot deflected off a defender and fell for McDonald on his stronger right foot. He slotted it straight past the keeper to give Celtic a 1-0 lead. 35 minutes into the match, Bystrov, who'd been causing Celtic, mainly Lee Naylor, many problems, sprinted past Lee Naylor again and if it wasn't for captain Stephen McManus blocking the shot, it could've been 1-1. Just before half time Spartak scored from a corner after scrappy Celtic defending. Vennegoor of Hesselink and Mark Wilson couldn't clear the ball and Pavlyuchenko, who missed a penalty earlier, controlled and slotted the ball past a very angry Artur Boruc. In first half stoppage time, Bystrov powered down the left wing and Naylor gave away another corner, luckily though the referee blew his whistle. But that didn't stop Artur Boruc from going over to Lee Naylor and shouting at him. Lee Naylor hit back and if it wasn't for Caldwell and McGeady breaking it up they could've both been sent off. The second half started as lively as the first. Vennegoor of Hesselink was being held in the box in the 51st minute but no penalty was given. The next big chance was when the ball fell for Vennegoor of Hesselink in the 65th minute, he turned and dragged a point-blank shot wide. From the 77th minute onwards the game started to open up with McDonald and Vennegoor of Hesselink having two great chances before Nakamura had three chances in two minutes. In the 84th minute Nakamura had a chance to score a free-kick after Vennegoor of Hesselink was taken down by Martin Stranzl, 21 yards out from goal. Stranzl was then sent off by the referee and Spartak Moscow were left with ten men for the remainder of the match. Unfortunately Nakamura's free-kick hit McDonald as it made it's way toward the goal. Celtic and Spartak both had chances before the full time whistle went. Celtic were very attacking from the start of extra time. The man advantage seemed to be helping Celtic as McDonald and Vennegoor of Hesselink both missed good chances in the first five minutes. In the 99th minute Aiden McGeady made a good run down the right wing to find nobody in the box. Forced to make a shot, it ended it up going off for a throw in. Just before extra time half time Derek Riordan, who replaced McGeady, picked up the ball and slammed a brilliant shot just a yard wide on his European début. Five minutes into the second half of extra time, Maksym Kalynychenko hit a superb shot which Boruc got a vital touch to. The ball then went straight down to the Spartak box but Vennegoor of Hesselink could only hit into Stipe Pletikosa's hands. In the 24th minute, Celtic were gifted a penalty after Scott Brown's power shot struck Radoslav Kováč's arm. Vennegoor smashed the penalty into the bar. Six minutes later the referee blew the whistle.

The Bloc Québécois backed Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's second budget yesterday, which means that there will be no federal election yet. "Having said that, there's money on the table [for Quebec]," bloc leader Gilles Duceppe said, "so we'll take that money." However, the opposition Liberals and NDP did not back the budget. NDP Leader Jack Layton said the budget is giving more money to companies and less to Canadian citizens. The budget also has been criticized by some finance critics. "He should have had a strategy," Liberal Leader and former Environment Minister under Jean Chrétien, Stéphane Dion, said today. "He should have explained how his budget would make us more competitive, how it would be fairer for those in need, how it would enhance the environment." "For every step forward, there seems to be two steps back," said Layton. "We could have supported child care or environment and given less to the big board rooms of Bay Street." Elections have to happen five years or less after a government is elected. The federal election of 2005 was held during winter. ==Related news== *

American newspaper ''USA Today'' reported on Thursday that the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) collected millions of call logs from telecommunications companies in 2001. The report comes almost four months after a previous NSA controversy involving the monitoring of international calls placed within the United States. Members of Congress called for answers from the government about the report detailing the agency's collection of records from telecommunications companies of American phone calls. The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee said that he was very shocked about the NSA revelation. "It is our government, it's not one party's government. It's America's government. Those entrusted with great power have a duty to answer to Americans what they are doing," said Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. AT&T, Verizon Communications, and BellSouth, three major telecommunications companies in the United States, began releasing logs of millions of phone calls to the NSA shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, according to the ''USA Today'' report. Earlier this year, the ''New York Times'' released a report stating that the NSA had been monitoring certain phone calls placed between the United States and other countries. Nominated CIA director Michael Hayden commented on the NSA program on January 23, 2006, stating: "The purpose of all this is not to collect reams of intelligence, but to detect and prevent attacks." Hayden was the head of the NSA during the programs' durations. President George W. Bush assured Americans that their privacy is being "fiercely protected." "We're not mining or trolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent Americans," commented Bush after leaving for a commencement address at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in Biloxi. According to the report, the information released by the telecommunications companies does not detail the content of the calls. The identities of those that placed and received the calls were recorded. The Supreme Court of the United States has previously ruled that logs of numbers dialed are not considered 'private' because they are being communicated to the telephone company.
<noinclude> In Toronto, Canada's largest city, a high school shooting this afternoon at around 2:35 p.m. killed one teenager. A grade 9 student, Jordan Manners, 15, was shot in the chest while near the swimming pool of C. W. Jeffreys Collegiate Institute in the Jane-Finch neighbourhood of Toronto. The boy was found lying in a school hallway at approximately 2:35 p.m. ET with a single bullet wound to the chest. He was then rushed to Sunnybrook Hospital, but died soon after the incident. The school quickly went into lockdown mode and students stayed in their classrooms for hours, though several came out in stretchers and were taken to Sunnybrook Hospital for hyperventilation. Police searched the building for weapons but found none. Shortly after, an Emergency Task Force (ETF) crew entered the building. An officer was stationed in every room during the lengthy lockdown. The school was taken out of lockdown at approximately 6:15 p.m. and students are being bused on TTC buses to a nearby middle school. "Students have a right to a safe school environment. It's shocking that such [an event] could take place in our schools," said Bill Blair, Toronto Police Chief. Mayor David Miller interrupted the city council to make a brief speech to the councilors when he heard the news. "I never thought that we would have to have a moment like this in Toronto when the mayor had to rise and say that a student of a high school in our city was found shot," he said. This is the first major violent incident to take place at an Ontario high school since 2000, when four students and one staff member were wounded in a knife attack at Cairine Wilson High School in Orléans, Ontario. This is the 13th Toronto killing involving gun-violence in 2007, and brings up Toronto's murder rate to 26 so far. <br><br> <div style="width:300px; text-align: center; border:2px dashed #69B0FF; padding: .0em .3em .0em; margin: 0 auto; background-color:#FFFFF"> <div style="background-color:#C4E0FF; padding: .0em .1em .05em;"> '''This story has ''new developments''.''' </div> ''Updated information can be found here'' </div>
A Long Beach, California man was shot today by Long Beach police. Police allege that the man lunged at police who returned fire and killed the man. Two police officers are reported to have been attending another call in the area when they noticed a man bleeding from his head and wielding a knife. The man did not listen to police orders to drop down and unsuccessfully tried to subdue him with a Taser stun gun. As the man lunged at the officers with a knife, both fired several rounds at him, killing him. ==Sources== * * * Category:California Category:Crime and law
The "Delivering a Sustainable Railway" white paper Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly The government of the United Kingdom has outlined its plans for the development of the Britain's railway network in a white paper presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly. Ruth Kelly described the report as "the most ambitious strategy for growth on the railways in over 50 years" and announced that capacity will be increased to cope with an expected 20% growth in passenger numbers over the next seven years through a £10 billion investment. The government is to continue to limit the rate of increase of regulated tickets, which include standard season and saver tickets, to a maximum of 1% above inflation, and plan to introduce a simplified ticketing structure of four basic ticket types. Today's announcement also extended the government's commitment made in March of this year to fund extra carriages. An additional 300 brings the total to 1,300 carriages to be acquired to relieve overcrowding. The impact of the investment the government has outlined will be concentrated in tackling areas of high overcrowding on the rail network. In particular, Ms Kelly has highlighted a number of key projects. These include the improvement of Reading and Birmingham New Street stations and the approval of the Thameslink modernisation programme. 150 stations across the network will be upgraded and refurbished at a cost of £150 million. The largest opposition party, the Conservative Party, greeted the release with much scepticism, saying that the paper contains "reheated announcements that are years later than promised". A spokeswoman for the Liberal Democrats described it as a "missed opportunity" to encourage more people to use trains in favour of cars or planes and suggested that much of the investment outlined in the document had been announced before. George Muir, of the Association of Train Operating Companies which represents the companies providing passenger train services on the British rail network, said that the white paper is the "first plausible plan for expanding the railway" in recent years. ==Sources== * * * Category:United Kingdom Category:Transport Category:Rail transport Category:Politics and conflicts Category:Economy and business
Hurricane Rita weakened to become a category 3 storm on Friday with sustained winds of 125 mph. The [http://poly9.viavirtualearth.com/poly9/msnbc-rita/ forecast path] is centered near the Texas-Louisiana border. The core of the hurricane is expected to approach the Texas and Louisiana coasts late on Friday. 3-day forecast path. Rita is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 8-12 inches, with the storm slowing down and producing a total of as much as 25 inches across eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Bursts of tropical storm winds and rainfall amounts of 3-5 inches are possible in New Orleans. The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimated that 6 inches of rainfall could breach the previously damaged levees. New Orleans' Ninth Ward, which saw as much as 20 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina, is currently in waist high water as a nearby levee was overtopped. Water is spilling over the levee in a section 100 feet wide. Near the center of the storm, coastal storm surge flooding of 15 feet above normal tide levels is expected, reaching 20 feet in bays and rivers. News of 3 levee breaches in New Orleans are being broadcast in televised reports. Tides are about 2 feet above normal along the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama coasts, and tides will increase to 4-6 feet above normal, with large waves and swells. == Earlier stories == * *
The Australian parliament will apologise tomorrow for past mistreatment of Australia's indigenous population. The wording of the apology will be revealed after 5pm AEDT (UTC+11) today, and will be read in parliament tomorrow at 9am AEDT. Opposition leader Brendan Nelson has given in-principle support to an apology, but has criticised the government for the delay in releasing the wording. He has written his speech without seeing the apology. "If Mr Rudd wants to unify Australia, to bring our nation together, the most important person he should be negotiating with is me," Mr Nelson said yesterday. "We're two days away from this, for goodness sake. He should be sitting down with me and saying 'these are the words which we propose, what do you think?" Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that the words must be tabled to parliament first. The Government's manager of business, Anthony Albanese, said that it was more important for members of the Stolen Generations to approve of the apology. "Quite frankly, what's important is the people most affected are comfortable with that wording," he said. In an opinion piece in today's ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', Tony Abbott defended John Howard's legacy. "Its refusal to say 'sorry' meant that Howard never received the credit he deserved for groundbreaking policies such as the intervention in Northern Territory Aboriginal townships," Mr Abbott wrote. "The Liberal Party's decision to support an apology to stolen children is not a repudiation of John Howard. It should help us to defend a key part of his legacy, the Northern Territory intervention, and to pursue good policy without accusations of bad faith."
''Wikinews'' has learned that the Church of Scientology has begun to falsely accuse the internet protest group ''Anonymous'' of a 2007 school shooting in Finland. The Church, on October 18, 2008 accused ''Anonymous'' of being involved in the November 2007 shooting at Jokela High School, in which a man named Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed nine people, including himself. "Anonymous member Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed seven students, a nurse and a teacher at Jokela High School in Finland before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life," said the Church in the October 18 press release. On October 17, the President of the Church of Scientology in New York City, John Carmichael, also accused ''Anonymous'' of being behind the shooting. One month ago, an article on CNN's citizen journalism wing, ''iReport'', also accused Anonymous of being behind the shooting, and several other alleged terrorist plots. The article also went on to accuse ''Anonymous'' of being behind the suicide of 14-year-old Megan Meier who killed herself after being 'cyber-bullied'. Scientology says the initial attack was done by a member of ''Anonymous'' named Josh Evans, who later turned out to be a false alias created by Lori Drew, the mother of one of Meier's friends. Meier's mother had previously had a falling out with Drew. ''Wikinews'' contacted the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in Finland by e-mail, seeking evidence or a statement to confirm or deny any connection to ''Anonymous'' and verify or debunk the claim made by the Church. ''Wikinews'' was able to confirm that there was no connection between ''Anonymous'' and the 2007 shooting. "According to the leader of the criminal investigation of the Jokela High School Shooting in 2007, there was no link between the group called 'Anonymous' and the offender [Auvinen]," said Tapio Ahola, Detective Chief Inspector of the NBI to ''Wikinews''. The Church also accuses ''Anonymous'' of plotting terrorist attacks against other schools, stadiums and even plotting a mall massacre which would allegedly have taken place in Los Angeles, California. The Church says that Jarrad Willis, who was arrested and questioned after posting the hoax massacre threat on ''4chan.org'', committed suicide while awaiting charges of internet crimes. ''Wikinews'' found that his suicide happened just one day before he was to be charged for a crime unrelated to the threat and that authorities had dropped all other charges against him, in relation to the hoax. The accusations appear to be part of a Scientology tactic developed by the organization's founder, L. Ron Hubbard called "fair-game". The Church uses this tactic to harass people, often fabricating lies and defamation against those who protest or criticize their beliefs. ''Wikinews'' contacted the Church several times by e-mail for a statement, but the Church has yet to reply. ==Related news== *
When a fan connects with a band, it's often during moments like a drive down a highway at night reflecting on some aspect of his or her life; sitting at home after a fight with a girlfriend; singing in the shower; or celebrating at a party with her friends. Music becomes a soundtrack to an individual's life, and a connection with the musician forms when the listener is able to peg a perfect moment or feeling to a song. Boston-based mega-member rock group Bang Camaro's fan base claims a different level of interaction: they often have ''learned'' to play their music before they ever had a moment associated with it. Bang Camaro found fame on the video game ''Guitar Hero II'', where an aspiring rock god uses a guitar-shaped peripheral to play rock music as notes scroll towards him on the screen. ''Wikinews'' reporter David Shankbone journeyed to the Bowery Ballroom to talk to the two founding members of Bang Camaro, Alex Necochea and Bryn Bennett. But when ''MTV.com'' shows up at the same time as ''Wikinews'' to do an interview, the band must split up. Below is our conversation with Necochea about touring, influence, politics, throwing his corpse out of a plane and flatulent women. ---- Image:Alex Necochea and Bryn Bennett by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|350px|Alex Necochea and Bryn Bennett<br><sup>photo: David Shankbone</sup> '''David Shankbone: How's the tour going? :'''Alex Necochea:''' The tours is going great! We just played in Poughkeepsie last night with the OCC house band. '''DS: Poughkeepsie, huh? :'''AN:''' Yeah! [''Laughs''] Poughkeepsie, it's kind of a dark town. Not much of a built-in crowd there. '''DS: What kind of crowd is there? :'''AN:''' From what I could tell, we played for a lot of Guitar Hero fans and people who heard about us through friends of friends, or came across us on MySpace. That sort of thing. But for the most part a lot of the kids we meet are anywhere between...well, I guess at a club like that they have to be over 18, but usually they are just much younger kids who are video game fans, who have heard about us through Guitar Hero II. '''DS: What's that like to have a fan base that comes from primarily video games? Have you noticed a difference between being known as a local band playing in your city and being known through video games? How would you compare the audience? :'''AN:''' It's different. In our hometown it started off as just a big word of mouth thing. We had twenty guys in the band, so everybody had friends-of-friends. We started a groundswell that way. But when we get out of town, not in New York so much, but when we go to Chicago and Milwaukee and places like that they generally tend to be much younger people. It's a really big thrill for Bryn and I in that we are meeting kids who are just like us: young video game fans, aspiring musicians, usually males who picked up guitars. They come to us and say, 'Nobody plays guitar anymore like you guys do!' or 'My parents used to listen to music like that!' It's just a big thrill for us to meet young kids like that who remind us of ourselves when we were kids. '''DS: How does it feel to be looked-up to by the kids, by America's future? :'''AN:''' [''Laughs''] It's terrifying! [''Laughs''] '''DS: Do you see parents at the show? :'''AN:''' Oh, yeah, oh yeah. Parents with their kids— '''DS: That must reduce the crotch grabbing. :'''AN:''' [''Laughs''] Yeah, a little bit of macho posturing. I tell you man, it's a ''really'' big thrill, just to go out and play in towns we've never been to. Kids come out and they know all the songs. We've had situations where we've played New York and girls are in the front row singing along to our guitar solos. Like, wow...we're on stage playing and we can hear them singing back at us. Something else Bryn and I have noticed is at larger festival shows when we get to the end of our shows we play ''Push Push Lady Lightning'', the kids would just light up and start air guitaring! But not ''actually'' playing air guitar, but playing air guitar hero--like, they knew where all the notes were! '''DS: Which is a ''lot'' different for audiences of many bands. :'''AN:''' Absolutely! I can't imagine other bands having the same experience, because we come from such a unique perspective that a large part of our music is driven by the instrumentals, and that sort of thing. '''DS: Your fans are so engaged with your music, far more than most bands have. Most bands they have fans who feel their music speaks to them, but your fans can say, 'I learned to play guitar on ''your'' shit and not on ''Eleanor Rigby''!' :'''AN:''' It's an honor. It's still unbelievable to me. I had a message from a friend of mine who was at Guitar Center and he heard one of the kids cranking out one of our songs when he was trying out the guitar. To me, it's like we made it. '''DS: At this point of your career, you're not playing stadiums, but you're also not playing Otto's Tiki Lounge on a Tuesday night. When you reflect upon it, what do you think about? :'''AN:''' In the past two years, since Bryn and I started this project, we've both been playing in bands locally in Boston for years. We had some mixed success, we played large venues in and around Boston. We got to the point where we said fuck it, we just want to have some fun and we'd laugh a lot going over old Ozzy Osbourne stuff we listened to as kids, just giggle about it. Bang Camaro started that way, something for us to do and invite our friends to come sing on it. Now, just two years later, it's amazing what happens when you stop trying. It's something not contrived or born of any desire to reach an audience. We just did it for fun, and that spoke to people more than anything else we worked on. '''DS: Do you have other areas of your life where you've been able to apply that? :'''AN:''' [''Laughs''] You mean as an ethos? Don't try? [''Laughs''] You know, not really. I have found the greatest success in the things I have put most of my effort into. This band has been a complete unique experience in that respect, at least in terms of trying to forge a 'career in music.' Bryn and I had gotten to the point where we thought maybe this wasn't the way to go. Bryn was going to go back to his career as a video game programmer and I was just going to find something else to do. So not really, I don't really apply that in any other portion of my life. '''DS: What are some dream projects you'd like to work on? :'''AN:''' As a musician, obviously for me it would be to meet and work with some heroes of mine since I was a kid. Like Mutt Lang; he always made my favorite records. At the same time, it has also been a dream of mine to meet people like Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse. Those guys made honest sort of rock n' roll, for lack of a better comparison, the way people like John Lennon or Bob Dylan would. To me those are the artists of my generation. It would be my dream one just to meet those guys and two just to work with them on some level. I'd also be lying to say that it would just be my dream to take this project with twenty of my best friends and take it as far as we can take it. So far in my life it's been the most rewarding thing. '''DS: In the creative process it's so difficult to be original today. Everything has been done. Do you ever let that trip you up, the ''Simpsons Did It'' problem? :'''AN:''' No, not really. I found I would end up falling into that cycle playing in indie rock bands, just trying to come up with the next thing, like Radiohead they stopped using guitars and things like that. Trying to kick the ball forward a little bit instead of kicking it side to side. With this band we don't get hung up on that. We originally just started it as a celebration of the things we loved when we were kids. We're not out here trying to reinvent the wheel. We're fortunate in that when we were putting the project together we wanted that big vocal sound. What set us apart was how we went about doing that. We just invited all of our friends because we didn't want to multi track everything ourselves. Soon after we had to figure out how to pull it off live, and people would approach and say 'we heard you have this crazy project with all these people.' The project grew into the live monster it is out of necessity. We're not rich people, we don't have refrigerators and the big tour bus. Speaking of dreams, maybe one day we'll have a tour bus. For now, we travel in two very smelly vans. '''DS: If you could choose your own death, how would you die? :'''AN:''' [''Laughs''] I would want to steal what I heard a mutual friend of ours said. He said when he died--it's not how he died, but this is what I heard--he said when he's dead, he wants his corpse to be dressed up like Superman and thrown out of an airplane. I thought that would be fitting. But I'm not ready to think about death, not just yet. '''DS: You guys have been described as Metal and Glam rock. What would you describe your sound as? :'''AN:''' I would call us anthem rock. We're really not heavy metal. I think our focus is more on writing great singles, as best as we can make them. Pop music. That's just something Bryn and I grew up on. We're big fans of melody and big driving hooks, that sort of thing. '''DS: Would you say anthem rock more in the Mötley Crüe vane or more in the T. Rex vane? :'''AN:''' I would say half and half. Our influences don't just stop with hair metal and things like that. We draw on things like Thin Lizzy, Boston, bands like that. Not necessarily virtuosic sort of musicianship, but things that are put together. We like to spend the time when we are writing our songs that we are taking all the extraneous crap out of it. We just want to make good, hook-drive pop music. '''DS: Does the war in Iraq affect you artistically at all? :'''AN:''' [''Laughs''] No, not at all. No, you could say I'm just like everybody else. I read the paper and blogs, and I'm just as horrified as everybody else. I'm definitely not a fan of this war. '''DS: If you had to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan, where would you fight? :'''AN:''' Oh, the fight was definitely in Afghanistan. Iraq was a much different animal. '''DS: Are you more inspired by things in nature or things that are man made? :'''AN:''' I would probably have to go with nature. I'm a student of science. I have a degree in environmental geology. When I was 19/20 years old I went through all the regular existential questions people that age go through: why am I here and my place in the universe, that sort of thing. "You can typically read anywhere that humanity is a virus, a plague, on Mother Earth. I really think the greatest threat to humanity is not a meteor or comet hurtling toward the planet, it's us."<br><sup>photo: David Shankbone</sup> '''DS: Did you answer any of them? :'''AN:''' Oh, God! I play rock guitar in a twenty man band! '''DS: That's important for a lot of people - you see your audience. You're giving a lot of inspiration to a lot of people. You don't know who you might be inspiring to pursue music. :'''AN:''' [''Laughs''] Oh, kids, don't be like me! I would definitely go with nature over man made. '''DS: What's your favorite curse word? :'''AN:''' Fuck. '''DS: What's your favorite euphemism for breasts? :'''AN:''' Big guns. '''DS: Have you used that recently? :'''AN:''' Actually, I think I did use that in the last week, and no comment. '''DS: I read that you named the band after fast women and fast cars. :'''AN:''' [''Laughs''] Who told you that? No, Bang Camaro were two words out of the English language that were the two sexiest words we could think of. We put them together and they roll off the tongue. Bang Camaro. It says a lot more than it means. '''DS: What sort of qualities do you look for in a woman? :'''AN:''' I need a girl who is going to make me laugh. I need a woman who is smarter than I am. A woman who will always keep me guessing. Absolutely. Calling me out for my own jerky bullshit. I like a girl who is fiercely independent, knows what she wants, and doesn't need me. '''DS: Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama? :'''AN:''' Oh, man, I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for saying Obama. I would probably go with Obama. There's just something in his rhetoric and his oratory that is a lot more inspiring than Hillary. Hillary, to me, represents not much of a changing of the guard. '''DS: What would be the greatest of misfortunes to befall you? :'''AN:''' [''Chuckles''] Oh, if I were to die alone. No, probably one of my greatest fears is injuring or maiming any of my appendages, to be honest. '''DS: Do you have any special things you do to make sure you don't injure or lose an appendage? :'''AN:''' [''Chuckles''] I don't keep my hands in my pockets when I am running down stairs. '''DS: That's a conscious choice? :'''AN:''' Yes, that's a conscious choice. '''DS: What if you are just walking down stairs? :'''AN:''' [''Chuckles''] You can't realign the stars, man. Shit will happen, shit will happen. '''DS: What possession do you treasure most? :'''AN:''' That's a good question. Probably my cat. I love my cat more than anything. '''DS: What's your cat's name? :'''AN:''' Sadie. '''DS: Like ''Sexy Sadie''? :'''AN:''' Yeah, like Sexy Sadie. That's exactly what I named her after. Big John Lennon fan, so I couldn't resist. '''DS: What trait do you deplore most in other people? :'''AN:''' I'm a lover, not a fighter. Jealousy, greed. But I try to look for the best in everybody. Who knows. '''DS: What do you think are the greatest threats to humanity? :'''AN:''' Humanity itself. You can typically read anywhere that humanity is a virus, a plague, on Mother Earth. I really think the greatest threat to humanity is not a meteor or comet hurtling toward the planet, it's us. We'll be our own undoing. Bad politics, the spread of...oh, man, I could get in trouble... '''DS: Who would you get in trouble with? :'''AN:''' No, I don't know who I could get in trouble with. But I definitely think that capitalism is something that having gone unchecked for so long isn't doing right in delivering civil freedom. It's not delivering on its promises. Then again, I play in a rock band and people come pay to see me. I understand it works on both levels. '''DS: What would be a bigger turn-off in bed: a woman who spoke in a baby voice, or someone who was overly flatulent? :'''AN:''' Oh God! I'd go with the baby talk, man. '''DS: You'd prefer the baby talk? :'''AN:''' No, I would go with the flatulent woman. At least she's real. '''DS: Have you ever been faced with either scenario? :'''AN:''' No, I don't think women should be flatulent. '''DS: At all? Not even if she lets out a little giggle afterwards? :'''AN:''' Yeah, well, so be it. '''DS: What if she was ''really'' flatulent? :'''AN:''' Like, ''extremely'' flatulent? I'd go more for the flatulence. Baby talk...that's a real boner killer. Sorry, man. '''DS: And you've never had a baby talker? :'''AN:''' No, not since high school. '''DS: In high school? :'''AN:''' Oh, yeah. She had to go. '''DS: What if she was Dutch oven flatulent? :'''AN:''' Is it really one or the other? Can I just go gay? '''DS: You can always go gay. It's the new millennium. :'''AN:''' Yeah, well, I'd probably end up with a baby-talking overly flatulent man, I'm sure.
Virginia duck and goose hunters, and waterfowl hunters in other parts of the U.S., might for the first time find themselves approached by state game officials who are testing harvested birds for the presence of Avian Flu. The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) announced last week, at the start of the waterfowl hunting season, that it is working cooperatively with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Interior in its national strategy to monitor the spread of the pathogenic strain of Asian H5N1 among migratory birds. Species of particular interest are the brant, tundra swan, mute swan, mallard, and snow goose. VDGIF staff are in the field checking popular hunting spots, waterway boat ramps, and wildlife management areas where returning hunters may be asked to allow them to perform a swab test on bagged birds. The VDGIF press release says the procedure only takes seconds to perform, and those who bagged 3 birds of the targeted species can call the department to have someone come check the birds. Avian Flu first surfaced in Asia in 2003. It is uncertain what factors contribute to the spread of the disease, but newer strains of H5N1 are more communicable than earlier recognized strains. "Although the spread of H5N1 in Asia has been primarily due to movement of domestic birds, the movement of this virus into wild birds raised the possibility that these species may also spread the virus," the U.S.Department of the Interior found in its March 2006 interagency strategic plan for early detection of the disease. It was found that Avian flu moved into wild birds and caused mortality among species of barheaded geese, brown-headed gulls, black-headed gulls, ruddy shelducks, and great cormorants in China in 2005. The migratory flyways considered most at risk of disease transmission are on the Pacific side of the Americas in Alaska and the Pacific NorthWest, closest to Asia. The Atlantic flyway shares migratory influence from Europe and Africa where the Avian Flu has also been found. A low pathogenic strain of H5N1 that currently exists in North America is common among waterfowl. Testing for the more virulent strains involves swabbing the bird's throat or rectum. ==Sources== * * ==External links== * PDF format * Category:Environment Category:Avian Flu Category:Virginia Category:United States Category:North America Category:Influenza
A group of almost 150 prominent British Jews has launched a new organisation, Independent Jewish Voices, and criticized the British Jewish establishment for its uncritical views on Israel. An open letter titled "A Time to Speak Out: Independent Jewish Voices" was published in Monday's edition of the ''Times of London'' and reprinted on the ''Guardian'''s online site, stated that the group has "come together in the belief that the broad spectrum of opinion among the Jewish population of this country is not reflected by those institutions which claim authority to represent the Jewish community as a whole" and that the leaders of Britain's Jewish community, the Board of Deputies, has "consistently put support for the policies of an occupying power above the human rights of an occupied people," referring to Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip areas, which have been occupied and illegally settled by Israel since 1967. The letter was signed by over 140 prominent writers, actors, academics and intellectuals including author and writer Stephen Fry, academic Brian Klug, historian Eric Hobsbawm and film director Mike Leigh. Klug, in an article published in ''the Guardian'' announcing the launch of the group, argues for its necessity by asserting that the Board of Deputies actions in defence of Israel "suggests that British Jewry, speaking with one voice, stands solidly behind the Israeli government and its military operations," despite the fact that, according to Klug, "Jews were deeply divided over Israel's campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon last year." The launching of the new group comes on the heels of a dispute within the American Jewish community after the American Jewish Congress published an essay titled "Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism" in which criticism by liberal Jews of Israel was criticized as facilitating antisemitism. ==Sources== * * * ==External links== *[http://www.ijv.org.uk/ Independent Jewish Voices] Category:Politics and conflicts Category:Judaism Category:United Kingdom Category:Israel Category:Middle East Category:The Times (UK) Category:West Bank fr:Divergence avec les positions du Board of Deputies of British Jews sur Israël : un nouveau groupe de représentants juifs s'est formé
